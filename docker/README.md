PITFALL: This image is not set up for running jupyter. To see how that works, see the (very similar)
  docker image at https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/tax.co/tree/master/docker/,
  specifically the Dockerfile, README.md and commands.txt files in that folder.

The docker container here is based on the one at
  https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/anaconda3/
